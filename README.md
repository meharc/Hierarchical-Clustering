# Hierarchical-Clustering
The repository helps create a comprehensive online tutorial (i.e., an .html file created using RMarkdown) explaining the methodology of hierarchical clustering. It contains the R code for working out the computation for how the clustering and resulting dendrograms are calculated/computed (with relevant code displayed) in *tutorial.Rmd* file. The rendered output tutorial is available [here](http://rpubs.com/mkchat/992609)
